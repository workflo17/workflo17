# Sources, licences and obligations

This project redistributes **derived databases** built from eight upstream sources. Each carries
its own terms, and two of them impose obligations beyond attribution. Every licence below was
read from the source's own `LICENSE` file or README, not from memory.

If you fork, deploy or publish this, these terms travel with the data.

---

## The code

Everything in this repository that is not derived data — the page, the shaders, the build
pipeline — is **MIT**. See `LICENSE`.

## The derived data

`build/` regenerates every data file from the upstream sources; nothing derived is committed to
this repository. If you *do* redistribute the built output (a deployment does), these apply.

### 1. Ancient genomes — AADR v66

Obtained through the [Poseidon `aadr-archive`](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/aadr-archive),
which republishes the Allen Ancient DNA Resource as Poseidon packages.

**The AADR requires two citations, not one:**

> Mallick, S., & Reich, D. (2024). *The Allen Ancient DNA Resource (AADR): A curated compendium of
> ancient human genomes*, v66.0. Harvard Dataverse. https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FFIDCW
>
> Mallick, S., Micco, A., Mah, M., Ringbauer, H., Lazaridis, I., Olalde, I., Patterson, N., &
> Reich, D. (2024). The Allen Ancient DNA Resource (AADR) a curated compendium of ancient human
> genomes. *Scientific Data* 11. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03031-7

Cite the specific version used (this build: **v66_p1_1240K**). Cite Poseidon as the route, not as
the source.

### 2. Radiocarbon — p3k14c

Package code MIT; the database is archived at tDAR.

> Bird, D., Miranda, L., Vander Linden, M., et al. (2022). p3k14c, a synthetic global database of
> archaeological radiocarbon dates. *Scientific Data* 9, 27.
> https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01118-7 · data: https://doi.org/10.48512/XCV8459173

### 3. Ancient places — Pleiades v4.1 · **CC BY 3.0**

> *Pleiades: A Gazetteer of Past Places.* Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, NYU.
> https://pleiades.stoa.org

Pleiades additionally **asks to be told about reuse** — `pleiades.admin@nyu.edu` — because reuse
reports are what justify its continued funding. If you deploy this publicly, send that email. It
costs nothing and it is the reason the gazetteer still exists.

### 4. Roads and routes — AWMC · **ODbL 1.0 — share-alike**

> *Ancient World Mapping Center.* University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
> https://github.com/AWMC/geodata — derived from the *Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman
> World* and from AWMC modifications to OpenStreetMap.

**This is the one with teeth.** The [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/) is
share-alike for databases: the route layer this project builds is a *Derivative Database*, so if
you publicly distribute it you must

- release **that derived database** under ODbL 1.0,
- keep the attribution to AWMC, the Barrington Atlas and OpenStreetMap visible, and
- offer the derived database in a machine-readable open form.

MIT on the code does **not** launder this. The atlas satisfies it by naming AWMC and its licence
in the page's own provenance panel, shipping the route data in an open documented format, and
regenerating rather than vendoring it here.

### 5. Languages — Glottolog CLDF · **CC BY 4.0**

> Hammarström, H., Forkel, R., Haspelmath, M., & Bank, S. *Glottolog.* Max Planck Institute for
> Evolutionary Anthropology. https://glottolog.org

### 6. Societies — D-PLACE Ethnographic Atlas · **CC BY 4.0**

> Kirby, K. R., et al. (2016). D-PLACE: A Global Database of Cultural, Linguistic and
> Environmental Diversity. *PLOS ONE* 11(7): e0158391.
> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158391

### 7. Ancient metagenomes — AncientMetagenomeDir · **CC BY 4.0**

> Fellows Yates, J. A., et al. *AncientMetagenomeDir.* SPAAM Community.
> https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AncientMetagenomeDir

### 8. Land outlines — Natural Earth · **public domain**

## Beyond licensing

Licence compliance is the floor, not the ceiling.

**Human remains are not just data points.** Every dot in the genomes layer was a person, and many
were excavated under arrangements their descendants had no say in.

**The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance** — Collective benefit, Authority to control,
Responsibility, Ethics — exist because open-data norms (FAIR) were written without reference to
power or history. "It is publicly downloadable" and "it is mine to publish on a globe" are
different claims. Some ancient genomic data is deliberately held under community governance; the
[Aotearoa Genomic Data Repository](https://data.agdr.org.nz/) is the standard example. This
project uses only openly released data, and anyone extending it should check what they are adding
against https://www.gida-global.org/careprinciples before adding it.

**Be careful what the arcs assert.** A line drawn from one clade position to another is an
inference about where somebody's ancestors came from. Living communities have their own accounts
of that, and a glowing arc on a black globe is a rhetorically strong way to contradict them. The
interface's job — and the reason it argues with its own pace figures and flags its estimator
disagreements — is to keep that inference visible as an inference.
